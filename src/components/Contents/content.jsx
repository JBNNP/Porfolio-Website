        <p>
          I’m John Brian Capate, 23 years old. Fresh graduate with Bachelor’s
          Degree in Information Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was 10 years old when I was inspired by my Sister and my
          Brother-in-law to became interested in programming. There is an online
          game that I playing at that age.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game was made by 4 Filipino. Only one of them are a programmer. I
          loved the game and made me inspired to create my own game someday.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as I got older I realized that I no longer wanted to create a game
          anymore but those things lead me to where I am and to where I want to
          be.
